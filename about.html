				<p>In the Course unit of Network Information System it was proposed to carry out a work that uses the information provided by various API's of our choice and to develop a website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to present all this information. Get information about the region is a small work invented by me to respond to all requests made by the teacher. This work aims to obtain meteorological information of a certain region, both the region where the user finds it and a region marked on the map by the user, to present a short description of the city and the points of interest of that location. Points of interest will be able to be customized by type, museums, hotels, restaurants and more, and by distance search in km. The chosen APIs are as follows, darkSky for weather, wikipedia for the description of the city and finally several of google, places, geolocation, map and directions.</p>

					<p>Hyper Text Markup Language, is a markup language for creating web pages, and interpreted by browsers, this technology consists of joining the HyTime and SGML standards. HyTime is a standard used for structured representation of hypermedia and content based on time. SGML is a standard for text formatting, not developed for hypertext, but has become important for turning documents into hyper-objects and for describing links.
					</p>
					<p>Cascading Style Sheets is a mechanism used to format the style of an HTML page. These styles can be added directly into the element, can be added in the header of the html document and identify the HTML elements with specific tags, or else, the most organized way is in own documents .css identify the html elements with the proper tags, and create a link that identifies you in the HTML document header.</p>
					<p>JavaScript is an interpreted front-end programming language, used to perform small client-side scripts, without the need to access the server. It is fairly used to work with the HTML page design and some iterations. Currently it is being used as a server language as is the case of the node.js, angula.js and others frameworks. It is a language based on ECMAScript and standardized by Ecma international in the specifications ECMA-262 and ISSO / IEC 16262.</p>

			<p>Bootstrap is a framework for developing interface and front-end components for websites and web applications. Uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript based on design templates for typography and enhancing the user experience.
				With the emergence of such frameworks, designs began to think of their sites with the mobile-first methodology. </p>
				<p>
					Mustache is a system of web templates available in various web programming languages. It is system without logic because it does not contain any explicit instruction of control of flow.

			<p>JQuery is a JavaScript function library used to interact with HTML, used in more than 70% of the most visited sites in the world and is the most popular JavaScript library. It is designed to make it easier to navigate the HTML document, from selecting DOM elements, creating animations, manipulating events, and developing AJAX applications. These facilities allow programmers to create layers of abstraction for low-level interactions in a simplified way in dynamic web applications of great complexity.</p>
			<p>Asynchronous JavaScript and XML is the methodological use of technologies like JavaScript and XML, to make web pages more iterative with the user, with the use of asynchronous requests of information. Multiple requests can be made to the server, and the site does not stop waiting for the responses. The answers obtained can be both XML and JSON, the latter has been more used in recent times, and for transferring information that is not standardized. XMLHttpRequest has an important role in ajax web development technique to communicate with server-side scripts.</p>
			<p>JavaScript Object Notation is an open, compact, open standard format for simple and fast interchange of data between systems. It is a model of information transmission in text format, much used in web services that uses representational state transfer (REST) and AJAX applications.</p>
			<p>Extensible Markup language é uma linguagem de marcação para necessidades especiais, capaz de descrever diversos tipos de dados, e de fácil partilha de informação pela internet. Utilizado para enviar informação padronizada e que tenha que respeitar um determinado de regras, como é o caso de informação que tenha de ser enviada para departamentos de finanças entre outros. </p>
			<p>Hypertext Preprocessor is a general purpose open source scripting language, but more used for web development and can be embedded in HTML.
				What distinguishes PHP from JavaScript is that the code runs on the server side and the client only sees HTML, which is good for hiding more specific business rules.</p>

			<p>DarkSky was API used to obtain the meteorological information of a certain zone. In order to communicate with this API it was necessary to develop PHP code, because for security reasons it is not possible to make calls in JavaScript</p>
			<p>API used to incorporate the map into the work.</p>
			<p>With this API it is possible to obtain the location where the user is, and get the coordinates of a certain point on the map. Calls to this API were made through a proprietary API method that is imported into a JavaScript file when the application starts.</p>
			<p>with the google places API you can find out which points of interest exist in a certain zone of the map, and the details of each of them. To get this data, it has to be in different calls the API, in a first returns the points of interest and in the second call has to be for each point of interest it returns the details, like photo, address, contacts among others.</p>
			<p>With this API you can get the distance between 2 points on the map and represent a route on the map between these same points.</p>
			<p>I've used the wikipedia API to get a short description of the city where the search is done.</p>
